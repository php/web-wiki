====== Welcome to your new DokuWiki ======

Congratulations, your wiki is now up and running. Here are a few more tips to get you started.

Enjoy your work with DokuWiki,\\
-- the developers

===== Create your first pages =====

Your wiki needs to have a start page. As long as it doesn't exist, this link will be red: [[:start]].

Go on, follow that link and create the page. If you need help with using the syntax you can always refer to the [[wiki:syntax|syntax page]].

You might also want to use a sidebar. To create it, just edit the [[:sidebar]] page. Everything in that page will be shown in a margin column on the side. Read our [[doku>faq:sidebar|FAQ on sidebars]] to learn more.

Please be aware that not all templates support sidebars.

===== Customize your Wiki =====

Once you're comfortable with creating and editing pages you might want to have a look at the [[this>doku.php?do=admin&page=config|configuration settings]] (be sure to login as superuser first).

You may also want to see what [[doku>plugins|plugins]] and [[doku>templates|templates]] are available at DokuWiki.org to extend the functionality and looks of your DokuWiki installation.

===== Join the Community =====

DokuWiki is an Open Source project that thrives through user contributions. A good way to stay informed on what's going on and to get useful tips in using DokuWiki is subscribing to the [[doku>newsletter]].

The [[https://forum.dokuwiki.org|DokuWiki User Forum]] is an excellent way to get in contact with other DokuWiki users and is just one of the many ways to get [[doku>faq:support|support]].

Of course we'd be more than happy to have you [[doku>teams:getting_involved|getting involved]] with DokuWiki.
